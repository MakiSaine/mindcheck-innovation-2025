# MindCheck – AI Mental Health Detection Platform

MindCheck is an AI-based concept developed as part of the IT Project Management course (BU5300) at Kristiania University College.  
Although the work originated as an academic portfolio, it represents a project that could realistically be developed into a real-world innovation.  
The idea explores how artificial intelligence and data analytics can be used responsibly to detect early signs of mental health challenges through social media behavior.

By combining technology, ethics, and design thinking, MindCheck demonstrates how digital solutions can support mental well-being while maintaining privacy and GDPR compliance.  
This project showcases academic learning, leadership, and the potential for future implementation in the mental health technology field.

## Overview
MindCheck was designed to analyze social media content using AI to identify early indicators of anxiety, depression, or emotional distress.  
The platform aims to provide supportive feedback, promote healthy online behavior, and connect users with helpful resources — all while respecting user privacy and consent.  

The solution concept could integrate with platforms such as **Instagram**, **TikTok**, or **Snapchat** to reach a wider audience and raise awareness about digital well-being.

## Ethical and Privacy Aspects
MindCheck emphasizes responsible AI and user trust.  
Given the sensitive nature of mental health data, the following principles were integrated throughout the project:

- **Data Security:** End-to-end encryption and secure database management  
- **User Consent:** Compliance with GDPR and transparent data handling  
- **Bias Reduction:** Testing across diverse data samples to avoid discrimination  
- **Transparency:** Clear communication about how data is analyzed and interpreted  

Ethical considerations were central to every decision — balancing innovation with privacy, empathy, and fairness.

## Personal Reflection
This project provided valuable insight into the challenges of leading a cross-functional IT project from concept to execution.  
As project manager, I focused on creating structure, motivating the team, and ensuring progress through Agile cycles.  
What began as a school assignment became a meaningful experience that combined leadership, cybersecurity awareness, and social responsibility.

I genuinely believe MindCheck could evolve into a real-world solution that contributes to mental health awareness and support in digital environments.  
It demonstrates how technology, when guided by empathy and ethics, can be a powerful tool for positive change.
